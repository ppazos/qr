dcmqr usage
-----------

This describes how to use dcmqr with dcm4chee. 

dcmqr does DICOM query/retreive. 
	Query is done first with the DICOM C-FIND service. 
	Retrieve is an optional second step. It usually uses C-MOVE, but can use C-GET. 

C-MOVE is preferred over C-GET. For an explanation of why, see 
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1957005/dicom-c-get-vs-c-move 
	http://www.medicalconnections.co.uk/kb/Basic_DICOM_Operations 

This is the primary difference between them:
	C-GET - <Calling AET> tells <Called AET> "Use the existing C-FIND DICOM association to send the images you found back to me."
	C-MOVE - <Calling AET> tells <Called AET> "Create a new DICOM association to <Destination AET>, and send the images you found to <Destination AET>." 
		<Destination AET> is very often the same AE Title as <Calling AET>.

dcm4chee configuration is simpler if dcmqr uses the C-GET option. 
But dcm4chee in a production environment seldom permits this because of security concerns. 
	dcm4chee sends the images back on the same DICOM association used for query. 
	dcm4chee cannot verify the identity of the computer that initiated the association. 

Configuring dcm4chee to handle the dcmqr C-MOVE option can be complex, particularly if DNS and firewalls are involved.
But it is more secure. 
	dcm4chee can only send images to AE Titles configured in service=AE. 
	The AE Title configuration contains IP address and port.
	dcm4chee uses the IP address and port to initiate the DICOM association to a known computer.

Setup
-----	
The examples below assume the following: 
	- dcmqr will run in a terminal window on the user's workstation. 
		<Tools installation directory>\bin is either the current directory, or on the path.
		
		The workstation is assumed to run Windows. 
		For Linux, small changes may be needed, such as / in paths and ./dcmqr instead of dcmqr. 
		
	- dcmqr will query dcm4chee running on a different machine. 
		The <dcm4chee host machine> name is RadiologyServer, or perhaps RadiologyServer@MyHospital.com, 
		It is OK to use RadiologyServer's IP address (E.G. 10.0.0.1)
		If dcmqr is running on the same machine as dcm4chee, use localhost or 127.0.0.1
	
	- dcmqr will query/retrieve the image 
		orig-1.2.840.113619.2.131.571110706.1226051996.105600.dcm 
		
		This image can be found at at http://www.dcm4che.org/jira/browse/DCMEE-1830.
		dcm2txt lists the following tags for this image:  
			(0008,0016) UI #28 [1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.128] SOP Class UID (PET in this case)
			(0008,0018) UI #48 [1.2.840.113619.2.131.571110706.1226051996.105600] SOP Instance UID
			(0010,0010) PN #18 [TELERAD^QCTEST1^^^] Patient's Name
			(0010,0020) LO #8 [QCTEST1] Patient ID
			(0010,0021) LO #4 [JHH] Issuer of Patient ID
	
	- dcm4chee query service has been configured to accept incoming DICOM association requests from DCMQR to DCM4CHEE. 
		AE Titles are case sensitive.

Query only
----------
Find all studies on dcm4chee (Use Ctrl-C to interrupt if needed.)

	dcmqr  -L DCMQR  DCM4CHEE@RadiologyServer:11112

The format is
	dcmqr  -L <Calling AET>  <Called AET>@<dcm4chee host machine>:<Called port> 

	
Find all studies with a given Patient ID and Issuer of Patient ID. Return the Patient Name of each study. 
	
	dcmqr  -L DCMQR  DCM4CHEE@RadiologyServer:11112  -q00100020=QCTEST1 -q00100021=JHH  -r00100010


Find all images with a given Patient ID and Issuer of Patient ID. Return the Photometric Interpretation of each image. 
	
	dcmqr  -L DCMQR  DCM4CHEE@RadiologyServer:11112  -I  -q00100020=QCTEST1 -q00100021=JHH  -r00280004


Query/ Retrieve
---------------
The example query/retrieve commands below all do this:

	Find all studies with a given Patient ID and Issuer of Patient ID.
	Retrieve the images in those studies. 
		Negotiate an association 
			to send PET images (SOP Class UID = 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.128) 
			using any transfer syntax. 
		Store the retrieved images in C:\Test on the workstation. 
			dcmqr uses the images' SOP Instance UIDs as filenames for the received images. 
			Any previous files with those names will be overwritten. 
			
			dcmrcv used a slightly different filename convention, but still overwrites existing files. 

			
Query/ Retrieve with C-GET
--------------------------

	dcmqr  -L DCMQR  DCM4CHEE@RadiologyServer:11112  -q00100020=QCTEST1 -q00100021=JHH  -cget -cstore 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.128 -cstoredest C:\Test
	

Query/ Retrieve with C-MOVE
---------------------------
If C-MOVE is used for retrieval, 
	A third application can receive the images if <Destination AET> and <Calling AET> are different. 
	dcmqr will receive them if <Destination AET> is the same as <Calling AET>. 


- Receiving images with dcmrcv

	dcmrcv is run in a seperate terminal window. 
		dcmrcv must be started before dcmqr.

	dcmqr and dcmrcv both have DICOM associations on the workstation running the test. 
		They must use different ports. 

	<Calling AET> and <Destination AET> are different
		Here, <Destination AET> is set to DCMRCV. 
		
		dcm4chee must be configured so it can initiate DICOM associations for outgoing images to <Destination AET>

- Receiving images with dcmqr

	<Calling AET> and <Destination AET> are the same
		<Calling AET> and <Destination AET> are set to DCMQR.
		
		DCMQR is both 
			a Calling AE Title for an incoming association request to dcm4chee for querying
			an AE Title that will receive images from an association initiated by dcm4chee.
